Then things start looking up for Albert when he is invited by the Al-Jazeera television for an interview. Watch as events unfold and a hopeful Albert attends this meeting with many hopes of entering the Muslim world through this popular TV network.",

When she decides to re-locate overseas, they promise to meet each other after 3 years, and agree to keep in touch via the Internet. Rajesh starts to notice his hair-line receding, stops getting modeling assignments, and takes up clerical employment. Friends suggest a number of remedies to make hair grow, and he tries them all - including rubbing onion juice, applying Phenayil (household cleaner), fresh cow urine, as well as rubbing his knuckles. The hair does not grow back and he starts to slide - drinking alcohol with his friend, Sandeep. He will experience further shocks when Sanju will e-comment on his now visible baldness as 'Uncleji' and quite unceremoniously dump him on the pretext of her career - while his concerned parents, aware of his aging looks, put pressure on him to get married.",

About to have them killed, the Nawab changes his mind when his mentally-challenged sister, Anarkali, insists that Akbar is her long-lost lover, Salim, and wants to marry him. Hilarious chaos results in a small village where Akbar and Birbal end up - this is where Akbar must accept that he is married to Razia and be the father to two sons: Shahrukh and Salman - but he insists on calling Razia 'Appa' - much to her distress - and especially after he gets smitten with a Neetu Singh-look alike, Sultana. Things get even more complicated with the involvement of a witch doctor, Khairu, and a gangster named Dilawar.",

Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.",

Brown takes the dead man's clothes and papers and is able to pass himself off as a good citizen in 1850's Calaveras County. When Lawrence's sister dies, her daughter spends the little money she has to journey to California and live with her uncle. Arriving at the isolated cabin, she realizes he is an impostor, but his threats intimidate her into silence. Lacking money and protection, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the advances of the largely all-male population, and so must acknowledge Brown publicly as her uncle in order to continue to receive food, shelter, and his protection. Over time, this understanding of mutual convenience turns to affection, and he pledges to reform. When former members of his gang continue their dishonest ways, however, the now rehabilitated Brown falls under the suspicion of the local vigilante committee.",

Suddenly a sidekick without a hero, the duck decides to ally himself with DJ, whether he likes it or not. Consequently, Daffy is on the scene when DJ discovers that his famous movie star father was Damian Drake, known for playing suave international spies onscreen, is actually a suave international spy in real life--and has been kidnapped by the evil insane nerdy, prancing villain known as Mr. Chairman of the equally nefarious Acme Corporation. It seems that Damian knows the whereabouts of the mysterious magical and powerful Blue Monkey Diamond, and the Chairman will do anything to get his hands on it! With Daffy in tow, DJ hits the road in a desperate attempt to outrace the evil Acme stooges to the diamond and save the world from their evil clutches. Unbeknownst to the two neo-spies, they are also being followed by VP Kate and Bugs--the studio brass has decided that the rabbit needs a comic foil after all, and Kate's job is on the line if she can't get Daffy back to work ASAP.",

Roberts (Brian Donlevy) enlisted in World War I, and worked his way up gradually. He retired in 1935 but has been recalled as Executive Officer of the destroyer \"Cranshaw.\" Impressed by Roberts' vigor, the rear admiral raises him to command of the destroyer \"Warren,\" an over-age World War I ship that has been recommissioned. Masterman laughs at Roberts' new command, only to have the Admiral assign him as the Executive Officer of the \"Warren,\" under Roberts. The ship is to join a convoy which has already left Hawaii, bound for the United States. The Flagship of the convoy is the cruiser, \"Chattanooga,' with Admiral Thomas in command. On the way, a lifeboat is sighted. From it are picked up two old sailors, two women and twenty babies. Their boat had been sunk while evacuating them from Hawaii. Roberts puts Masterman in charge of the infants. The destroyer reaches the convoy. That night, the Japanese attack the convoy, the \"Chattanooga\" is hit, and the enemy then turns its attention to the \"Warren.\"",

Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.",

After a brief but memorable film career saw him starring in the cult classics Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare and Zombie Nightmare, Thor all but disappeared from the entertainment map. But ten years into retirement, and incapable of living like a normal mortal human being, Thor attempts a comeback to achieve the level of success that had eluded him his entire career - a comeback that nearly kills him. Tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of a determined performer over the course of a career that has seen more than its fair share of highs and lows, I AM THOR paints a fascinating and sometimes unbelievable portrait of this larger-than-life icon.",

If you're going to be watching these old actuality movies then you're going to already know that there isn't any sort of plot or anything like that. Instead we're basically just looking at a moment in time that was captured by the camera. I've always found these movies to be interesting because you get to see the type of things that were going on back in the day. This includes the type of clothing people are wearing or in this case an authentic streetcar in use.",

    "Plot": "John Brant, his only daughter, Gene, and Jan Karl, a farmhand, live on a farm in Central Africa, near the border of the jungle. The monotony of their lives is stirred by the arrival in the neighborhood of a hunting party, about to enter the jungle to secure wild animals for an American circus. Henry Barium, the young circus owner, heads the party. He prevails on old John Brant to accompany him on the trip and, in turn, agrees that Gene and Jan Karl shall join the expedition. Jan and Gene are \"as good as engaged.\" as the saying goes. Young Barium pays marked attention to Gene as they journey, and Jan grows jealous. One day he comes on the young people when Barium is trying to force a kiss from Gene. In the trial of strength that follows, Barium is worsted. Gene, who loves Jan, does not show that worthy due appreciation of his interference, with the result that he leaves the expedition for the Transvaal mines. Next day a noble, shaggy-maned lion is caught. He is of such dignified mien and enormous size that he is named Thor, lord of the jungle. Other wild animals are secured and the party starts on the return journey. When the Brant farm is reached. Barium gains the consent of Gene to accompany him to America, where he promises to make her queen of the circus. John Brant strongly opposes Gene's departure; but in vain. On the voyage to America. Gene discovers the true character of Barium. He is both gambler and drunkard, and attempts to take liberties with her. On her arrival in America, she is penniless, and is forced to work in the Barium circus, where she learns still more of the owner's vicious nature. Her mail is secretly destroyed by Barium and she believes herself forgotten and forlorn. Barium hatches a plot for her undoing, but \"Billie,\" the hunchback, who is devoted to Gene,, discovers it and saves her. He is aware that Gene spends much of her spare time near Thor's cage, and he plans so that Barium will join her there on a certain night. In the meantime, he files the bars of the big lion's cage, shortly before the meeting. Gene is ignorant of \"Billie's\" plans, and is shocked when Barium appears in a drunken state and attempts to attack her. She screams, and Thor breaks through the half severed bars and kills his master. The circus authorities decide on killing Thor; but Gene begs for his life. After much wrangling they consent and Thor accompanies Gene back to Africa and freedom.",

Instead, the couple will inadvertently unearth the cross-dressing Dr. Frank-N-Furter's (Tim Curry's) spooky lair of inexhaustible oddities, just in time to partake in the out-of-this-world mad scientist's proud unveiling of his latest, delightfully extravagant, most daring creation: the ultimate male and the perfect sex symbol: the flaxen-haired Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). But, little by little, as the effervescent transgressive force gobbles up whole the unsuspecting visitors of the night, Brad and Janet slowly begin to embrace the potent fascinations of seduction, while an idolized Rocky roams free in the mansion. Who can interrupt man's union with the absolute pleasure?",

Meanwhile, over in Pottsylvania, home of Rocky and Bullwinkle's arch enemies Fearless Leader, Boris, and Natasha, the Iron Curtain has fallen, leading the villains to leave Pottsylvania, and dig through a tunnel all the way to the TV of a Hollywood Producer, Minnie Mogul. She signs a contract, giving her the rights to produce the Rocky and Bullwinkle Movie, and accidentally pulls the three villains out of the TV, turning them into humans! Now, they have an evil plan to hypnotize America, using RBTV (Really Bad TeleVision), making everyone's mind mush, so he can go on to the TV, and get everyone to vote him President of the USA! However, new FBI Agent Karen Sympathy has an assignment--get the only ones who could ever defeat the villains- Rocky and Bullwinkle. Using a green light lighthouse, Rocky and Bullwinkle (and their Narrator) are sucked out of the TV world, and to real life as 3D computer-generated characters!

Wounded by a hand grenade overseas, Bleier returns to the States told he will never walk again. However, after a lengthy, grueling rehabilitation (and several slow motion sequences to thumping soundtrack music) Bleier ultimately walks again. Soon, he trains with his old team for inspiration. Boss Art Rooney (Art Carney)'s sympathy and regard for Bleier pays off when Bleier improbably comes all the way back, ultimately playing for a Superbowl Championship with the Steelers. But are all the good feelings and inspiration Bleier engenders enough to carry him to an NFL championship?",

One day when the girl has grown into a lovely young woman, she meets a prosperous and handsome older man through a strange twist of fate. They fall in love and are engaged to be married. On the very day of the wedding the poor mother wanders to the farmer's house. She sees a picture of her daughter as a three year old and recognizes her. Learning that the girl is to be married that day, the mother rushes to the church. When she arrives there she and the groom recognize one another, and immediately they both realize that Ben has nearly married his own daughter.

    "Plot": "This entry in Republic's \"Three Mesquiteers\" series has a misnomer for a title since the action takes place in Texas and pre-statehood Oklahoma, and the Rocky Mountains are in neither state, but Republic, which easily produced the best of the B-westerns, quite often used a title that had nothing to do with the locale of the film. Stony Brooke, Rusty Joslin and Rico are Texas Rangers unable to enter the territory known as the Panhandle as it is not part of the state, and lawlessness runs rampant there, under the guerrilla leader, King Barton. They discover a young boy, Danny Burke, wounded and left to die by the Barton gang. They nurse him back to health, but he is killed in another raid by the Barton outfit. Stony takes possession of the boy's gun and vows vengeance. Since the strip of land hiding the outlaws is under Federal authority, the Mesquiteers enter the territory with a plan to lure the outlaws across the Texas border. Stony, posing as his look-alike outlaw double known as The Laredo Kid, stages a jail break to free King Barton's younger brother Jim from a Texas jail and insinuates himself into the gang. Barton has been forcing a Panhandle gunsmith named Manners to provide weapons for him, and Manners' daughter, Doris, is antagonistic toward Stony, whom she believes to be The Laredo Kid. Stony soon convinces her of his true identity. The plot to lure the Barton gang into Texas is progressing nicely until the real Laredo Kid shows up and exposes Stony.",

    "Plot": "1903 London. Renowned playwright J.M. Barrie (James)'s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews, something he knew would be the case even before the play's mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow, James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author George L. Du Maurier) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends, largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children, James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives, he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them, the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvia's third, Peter Llewelyn Davies, who is still grieving the reality of their lives, where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family, and gone the next. Two other people who don't appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies' lives are: his wife, Mary Barrie, who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's overbearing mother, who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband, and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell, but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter, that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called \"Peter Pan\". This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband.",

John confides that his photo hobby quickly motivated him to set up a darkroom and devote large amounts of time printing.

In an attempt to confirm his suspicion, he selected about 100 images and put them online with the hope that the feedback would confirm his judgement as to the strength of the images.",

Sandra, newly minted Lady Abbott in her lawyer husband Mike Abbott having been knighted, does whatever needed to present a perfect upper crust life and marriage, including maintaining a proper decorum. Older Bif is the carefree one, living for the moment, including not caring that her council estate apartment in inner city London is a pigsty, just as long as she can find whatever she needs. While Sandra has no place for someone like Bif in her life, Bif laments what Sandra has become when she married Mike, Sandra once having had a real zest for life. When Sandra learns first hand that Mike has been having an affair for five years with one of her closest friends Pamela and eventually asks for a divorce in wanting to marry Pamela, Sandra, feeling like her planned retirement life with Mike has been pulled out from under her, turns to Bif for emotional support in not being able to turn to any of her friends in the shame. While Bif does whatever she can to accommodate Sandra, Sandra feels like a fish out of water in Bif's environs, which includes the adult community dance class she attends and which is populated by who are her closest friends. Among those is Charlie Glover, who, like Sandra, is going through a relationship crossroads in his marriage as his institutionalized wife Lilly is slowly slipping away from him with her Alzheimer's. In finally opening up to the joys of the dance and making connections with Bif's friends including Charlie, Sandra will have to evaluate her life in its entirety including if she is ready to put her upper crust life behind her and embrace a new life with someone caring like Charlie. Bif going through her own challenges may provide a deeper perspective for Sandra in what she really wants.",

One night, after Mia has shown Owen around the town, Halo sees him entering the elevator while he's dressed in a wardrobe borrowed from Sean's closet. Thinking he's rich, Halo flirts back and sets up a date. Mia, however, warns him that she just thinks he has money because he's living in Sean's apartment and is wearing Sean's clothes. On the day of the big date, Owen realizes who he really is and what he really wants in life. Meanwhile, Sean is falling in love with the local veterinarian, who happens to be harboring a big secret - two, actually. He's surprised when his ex-fianc\u00e9' appears on his doorstep, ready to accept his marriage proposal and move back to New York with him. This complicates Sean's blossoming relationship with the small town girl, who has told him that her career as a veterinarian relies on her staying where she is, and to simply enjoy their love while it lasts. On Christmas Eve, Sean invites Owen to come back for a special dinner, where a surprise awaits all of them.",

But when she turns eighteen, Alaska finds herself in front of a judge in adult court for some of the same out-of-control behavior. In lieu of a jail sentence, Alaska is ordered to do community service in an assisted living facility where she is assigned to Mrs. Foster, an elderly resident who is unapproachable at best and hostile at her worst. Will Mrs. Foster be Alaska's undoing or will she simply be another obstacle on the road to the headstrong girl's freedom? As Alaska tries to minimally fulfill her court obligation and dodge actual jail time, she deals with peer pressure, static from her family, outside influences and demons from her past. Can she navigate the tumult and re-discover a relationship with God and her family or will she remain caught in the cycle of bad choices and lose what little of either is left?",

Before long, Tom wonders if the show's slowly growing success is worth the pain it takes to get there...but he doesn't have to shoulder the burdens alone. \"Thriller Theater!\" is a gently comedic feel-good movie about the struggle to find a balance between \"real life\" and the pursuit of one's creative dreams.",

The last segment, \"Fanatical Extreme,\" is a condensed version of the feature film The Last Horror Film (1982), in which taxi driver Joe Spinell tries to realize his fantasy of making a horror movie with his favorite star, but he's not exactly welcome.",

During the 1930's, 40's and 50's, she teamed up with Paul Wing and would eventually become the most famous Asian American dance duo in this country's history. Known for dancing on her toes, she developed a unique, athletic style of performing. Toy and Wing were pioneers, performing on Broadway and in Hollywood films. They were also the first Asian Americans to dance at the London Palladium. Dorothy, whose real last name is Takahashi, continued to perform during World War Two, although her parents and relatives were all sent to an internment camp in Topaz, Utah. From the 1960's to the mid 70's, Dorothy managed and performed with her Oriental Playgirl Revue, which traveled throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. She also ran a dance studio in the basement of her Oakland home, where she taught hundreds of children how to dance. Now as she approaches the century mark, I believed this amazing woman deserved to have a documentary made about her.",

Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and a few are lucky to escape. Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X.",

Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his \"cure\". Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn't have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto.

But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.",

Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself.",

For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen. But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro, Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn, returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp.",
